## _ERROR 404, IDK how to design this_
# Helleo, I'm Fatima. A Developer, Designer, Writer, Human.
I'm Fatima Reefat - an aspiring full-stack developer and a part time writer who enjoys brainstorming ideas every once in a while. Presently a sophomore in National Institute of Technology, Warangal pursuing B Tech in Chemical engineering. <br>
For building websites, my weapons of choice are HTML/CSS/JS for giving it “the look” with lots of Bootstrap and for connecting everything to databases - Django. <br>
## _What you'll find here_
- Incomplete code files
- Codes I am proud of
- Embarassing codes(probably in a private repo)
- A couple on the verge of completing projects, find them in my portfolio [here](https://fatimareefat.github.io/my-portfolio/)

## _What I'm working on_
- Becoming less frustrated with Git command line
- Improving Django skills
